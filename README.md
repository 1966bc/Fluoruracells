According with the article 

"A Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry Method for the Determination of 5-Fluorouracil Degradation Rate by Intact Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells"

Fluoruracells aid laboratory thecnichian during the performance of  5-Fluorouracil Degradation Rate Method technique 

to calculate the volume of PBS to be used to bring the cell concentration to to give a concentration of 2–4 * 10^6 cells per 64 µL.

Written in Python on Debian 10 on summer MMXXI.

After downloading and unzip the file execute fluorouracells.py

In the entry box put the cell counting from am automatic citometer such as Advia 2120, Sysmex XE 2100, Alinity q and the algorithm

will calculate the amount of PBS and cells
