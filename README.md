According with the article 

"A Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry Method for the Determination of 5-Fluorouracil Degradation Rate by Intact Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells"

Fluoruracells aid laboratory thecnichian during the performance of  5-Fluorouracil Degradation Rate Method technique 

to calculate the volume of both PBS and mixed PBMCs in order to obtain a concentration of 2–4 * 10^6 cells per 64 µL.

Written in Python on Debian 10 on summer MMXXI.

After downloading and unzip the file execute fluorouracells.py.

In the entry box input the cell counts obtained from an automatic citometer such as Advia 2120 Siemens Healthcare, 

Sysmex XE 2100 TOA Medical Electronics, Alinity q Abbott, and the algorithm will calculate all the possible combination for the volume of both PBS, mixed 

cells and cells number.

These results were showed in the listbox, allowing the laboratory technician to choose the best combination.
