According with the article "A Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry Method for the Determination of 5-Fluorouracil Degradation Rate by Intact 

Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells", Fluoruracells aid laboratory thecnichian during the performance of  5-Fluorouracil Degradation Rate Method technique 

to calculate the volume of PBS to be used to bring the cell concentration to to give a concentration of 2–4 * 10^6 cells per 64 µL.

Written in Python on Debian 10 on summer MMXXI.

after downloading and unzip the file execute fluorouracells.py
