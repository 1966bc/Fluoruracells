# Fluoruracells
Help laboratory technicians during the performance of  5-Fluorouracil Degradation Rate Method technique

According with the articol "A Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry Method for the Determination of 5-Fluorouracil Degradation Rate by Intact Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells" 


Fluoruracells aid laboratory thecnichian during the performance of  5-Fluorouracil Degradation Rate Method technique to calculate the volume of PBS to be used to bring the cell concentration to to give a concentration of 2–4 * 10^6 cells per 64 µL.
